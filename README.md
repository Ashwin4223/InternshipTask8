# Understanding the Role of VPNs in Protecting Privacy and Secure Communication

This project demonstrates how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) help protect user privacy and enable secure communication online. It involves hands-on steps using a Chrome-based VPN extension and highlights VPN functionality, encryption, and performance considerations.

## 📌 Objective

To explore how VPNs change IP addresses, encrypt traffic, affect browsing speed, and contribute to secure and private internet usage.

---

### 4. **Traffic Encryption Confirmation**
To confirm encrypted traffic:
- Visit any secure website (e.g., `https://example.com`).
- Click the lock icon in Chrome’s address bar.
- Click “Connection is secure” → then “Certificate” to view HTTPS encryption details.

---

### 6. **VPN Disconnected – Speed/IP Comparison**
- Disconnected from the VPN.
- Compared IP and browsing speed on the same website.

### 7. **VPN Encryption & Privacy Features Research**
- VPNs use protocols like **OpenVPN**, **WireGuard**, and **IKEv2/IPSec**.
- Key privacy features:
  - IP masking
  - No-log policies (provider dependent)
  - DNS leak protection
  - Kill switches

---

### 8. **Summary of VPN Benefits & Limitations**

#### ✅ Benefits:
- Hides real IP address
- Encrypts internet traffic
- Secures public Wi-Fi usage
- Bypasses regional restrictions

#### ⚠️ Limitations:
- Free VPNs may collect logs or display ads
- Can slow down internet speed
- Not a full substitute for antivirus or secure browsing practices
- Trust in the provider is essential
